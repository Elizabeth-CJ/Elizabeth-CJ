# HR Analytics Dashboard – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Excel
## Executive Summary
This project is an exploratory HR dashboard built in Excel to analyze employee demographics, performance, and compensation patterns. The dashboard answers critical HR questions related to workforce structure, performance-based pay, and gender pay equity.

## Key Questions Addressed:
- How many employees do we have, and how are they distributed by age?
-	Do we reward performance fairly across salary bands?
-	Is there a noticeable salary gap between male and female employees?

## Methodology:
Built entirely in Excel, the dashboard includes:
-	PivotTables and PivotCharts to aggregate performance by salary band
-	Age group segmentation for distribution insights
-	Interactive slicers (department, gender, region, manager status)
-	KPI Cards: Avg Salary, Avg Age, Avg Tenure, % Top Performers
-	Calculated comparisons between male/female salaries

## Skills Used:
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-	Excel Dashboard Design
-	PivotTables & Charts
-	KPI Development
-	Gender Pay Analysis
-	Data Visualization & Storytelling
-	Business Insight Generation

## Results & Findings:
-	Pay for performance exists but may be inconsistently applied across genders.
-	Top male performers earn significantly higher salaries than bottom male performers. This trend that is less pronounced among female employees
-	The age distribution leans towards a mature workforce, highlighting a potential need for retirement planning, succession management and generational talent strategies.
-	There is a measurable gender pay gap of approximately 10.7%, with female employees earning less on average than their male counterparts. This warrants a deeper root-cause analysis.

## Recommendations:
-	Conduct a department-level pay gap analysis to identify whether discrepancies are localized or systemic.
-	Review performance-based bonus and salary increase structures for gender parity.
-	Use these insights to inform promotion, recognition, and retention strategies.


## Next Steps
-	Add time-series data to track trends in compensation, hiring, and attrition over time.
-	Integrate a deeper pay gap analysis using regression or statistical testing.
-	Incorporate attrition data to understand how performance and pay impact employee turnover.
